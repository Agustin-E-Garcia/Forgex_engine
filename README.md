A personal learning project exploring the creation of a destructible voxel engine, built from scratch in C++.

**Forgex Engine is an ongoing project, with new features and improvements being actively developed.**

## Overview
Forgex is a C++ game engine designed around fully destructible voxel environments, targeting small to medium bounded arenas. The engine uses Marching Cubes for smooth isosurface mesh generation from a scalar density field, with the objective of making destruction feel organic, surfaces deform and crumble rather than disappearing in discrete blocks.
The long-term goal is to ship a singleplayer horror demo built on top of this engine, where light and darkness are core gameplay mechanics in a fully destructible environment.

## Features
- **Modular Architecture:** Engine functionality split into independently compiled libraries (Core, Graphics, Scene, Voxel, Debug, Assets), linked into a single executable
- **Entity Component System:** Built on EnTT, with a clean separation between update systems and render systems
- **Marching Cubes Terrain:** Smooth voxel mesh generation from a scalar density field using Simplex Brownian Motion noise, with flat shading for a low-poly aesthetic
- **Chunk System:** Terrain divided into 32x32x32 chunks, each independently generated and meshable for future destruction support
- **Asset Manager:** Centralized asset loading and management with path-based deduplication
- **Debug Tooling:** In-engine developer console (F1) with command system, system profiler, entity inspector, material inspector and asset manager inspector

## Libraries Used
- **OpenGL:** Rendering
- **ImGui (Docking branch):** Engine UI and tools
- **EnTT:** Entity Component System
- **GLM:** Math calculations
- **SPDlog:** Console logging
- **GLFW/GLEW:** Windowing and OpenGL extensions
- **STBImage:** Image loading
- **NoiseFastLite:** Noise generation
- **Tiny_obj_loader:** OBJ mesh loader

## How to Build
1. **Clone the Repository** Pull the latest version of the project along with the submodules
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Agustin-E-Garcia/Forgex_engine.git
```
2. **Generate Build Files** Generate build files using CMake
```
cmake -B .
```
   > **Note:** If required is possible to add -DGENERATE_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON to generate and automatically copy the compile_comands.json to the root folder of the project
3. **Build the Project**
```
cmake --build .
```
4. **Run the executable** The executable can be found in the generated Build folder
```
cd Build/Bin/Forgex
./Forgex_Exec
```
   > **Note:** "Main" branch is a stable version of the engine that will compile and run, "Development" is an unstable branch where changes are being made often

## Goals
### Short-Term Goals
- Terrain destruction modifying the density field at runtime and remeshing affected chunks
- Particle System with inspector window to change parameters in realtime
- Adding back Windows Build support
- Sample scene showing the capacity of the engine at the moment

### Long-Term Goals
- Loading complex meshes with hierarchy using Assimp
- Game DLL loading — separate game code from engine runtime
- Singleplayer horror demo built on top of the engine

## Status
Forgex Engine is currently **a work in progress**, designed as a personal learning project and a showcase of technical skills. Contributions or forks are not expected, but feedback is always welcome!
